One of the oldest thing I have done. Just for training.

It is a software with gui based on Python2 and PyQt who controls an Arduino UNO board connected to an RGB strip led.


Hardware needed:
-Arduino UNO Board
-Breadboard
-Strip Led RGB
-Arduino wires M/M M/F
-3 N-Channel MOSFET

Software:
I have took some code on the internet from the user "Jkm3141"
http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=8332.0
on the arduino forum.
Icons are from Faenza Icon of Tiheum. http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228
I have expanded the project to learn something with Arduino, Python, PyQt.
This is what it came out.


P.S.: Hardware connection has to be done like in the image in the link

The only changes are the pin used. I used 9,10 e 11.
